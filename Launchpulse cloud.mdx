# LaunchPulse Cloud

LaunchPulse Cloud is the managed infrastructure layer that takes your generated application from “working in the editor” to “live on the internet.” Once your project is ready, you can deploy it to LaunchPulse Cloud without touching servers, Docker, or DevOps.

With LaunchPulse Cloud you can:

- Deploy your app from a specific **project version**
- Set up **environments** (e.g. staging, production)
- Attach **custom domains** and automatic SSL
- Inspect **logs** and basic runtime metrics
- Roll back to previous versions when needed

The goal is simple: your agents focus on building the app, and LaunchPulse Cloud focuses on running it reliably.

On this page, we’ll explain how deployments work, how to connect domains, and how LaunchPulse Cloud fits into your overall development and iteration workflow.

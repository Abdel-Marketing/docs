# Introduction to LaunchPulse

LaunchPulse is your **AI software team + runtime platform** in the browser.

You describe the product you want to ship, and LaunchPulse:

- Plans it like a product squad
- Builds it like an engineering team
- Tests it like a QA department
- Hosts it like a managed cloud platform

All inside a single, integrated system.

## What makes LaunchPulse different?

Most “AI coding” tools are an editor with a model bolted on. LaunchPulse is **infrastructure-first**:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Agent-native architecture">
    Multiple specialised agents share a single project brain - product, UX, frontend, backend, database, QA, and ops.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integrated cloud runtime">
    Hosting, databases, domains, auth, and test users are wired into the platform from day one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous validation">
    Browser-based QA, validation agents, and structured docs keep the build aligned with the spec as it evolves.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The result feels less like “I asked for some code” and more like:

> “I spun up a small product team and a managed cloud just for this app.”

## From idea to running app

At the very top of LaunchPulse is a simple box:

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-12at23.13.40.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse idea input box with example templates"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

You describe your idea in natural language - as detailed as you like. Behind that input sits the rest of the system:

- A **Product & UX layer** that turns your description into specs and flows
- An **Engineering layer** of agents that compile those specs into code, APIs, and schemas
- An **Infrastructure layer** (LaunchPulse Cloud) that runs the app, manages data, and exposes a live URL

You focus on the idea and the outcome. LaunchPulse orchestrates everything between.

---

## The LaunchPulse architecture

Conceptually, LaunchPulse is three tightly connected layers.

### 1. Product intelligence layer

This is where your idea becomes something the system can build.

- Product Manager, UX, and architecture agents create PRDs, FRDs, DRDs, and BRDs.
- Requirements, edge cases, and non-functional constraints are captured up front.
- This documentation becomes the source of truth for downstream agents.

### 2. App assembly layer

This is the “AI team” people usually see - but running on top of that shared brain.

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-14at21.04.48.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse structure overview graph"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

- Frontend, Backend, Database, API Architect, and Ops agents work from the same spec.
- Code, schemas, and APIs are generated as a single coherent system.
- Validation agents keep checking: _does this still match the spec?_

### 3. Cloud runtime layer

Once the app is assembled, it has somewhere to live — **LaunchPulse Cloud**.

- Managed hosting for your frontend and backend
- Managed database attached to your project
- Domains, certificates, and auth wired in
- Browser QA and monitoring integrated into the same UI

You don’t jump between a model, GitHub, a database dashboard, and a cloud console.\
It’s one environment.

---

## Infrastructure that’s already there

### Managed database per project

Every project ships with a fully managed database that grows with your app.

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-13at06.21.54.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse database tab"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

- Tables and schemas are generated by the Database Agent.
- You can browse, filter, edit, and add rows directly from the **Database** tab.
- No separate DB provisioning, connection strings, or migrations to set up manually.

For quick fixes or demos, you can even click into a cell and update data inline — ideal for testing flows.

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-13at23.45.50.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse database view"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

---

### Preview & live app in one click

When agents finish a build, your app is already runnable.

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-13at23.37.13.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse preview tab"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

- Use the **Preview** tab to interact with the latest build without deploying.
- Click **View App** to open the live preview in a new window.
- See exactly what users will experience before you press Deploy.

---

### Auth, test users & roles baked in

Authentication isn’t an afterthought. LaunchPulse creates real accounts and roles for you.

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-14at18.10.41.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse test users sidebar"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

- Built-in signups, logins, and password resets.
- Test users generated automatically, visible in the left sidebar.
- Copy credentials and log in as different user types to test flows quickly.

This lets you validate permissions, dashboards, and role-specific flows before inviting real users.

---

### Browser QA & AI test engineer

On top of normal validation, LaunchPulse can actively **use your app** to test it.

<img
  src="/Screenshot2025-11-07at23.47.07.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse AI Testing panel"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

- A self-testing browser agent navigates through key flows.
- It captures runtime errors, broken journeys, and layout issues.
- Results feed back into the build pipeline so agents can fix issues in context.

Instead of stopping at “it compiles,” LaunchPulse pushes toward **“it behaves correctly for real users.”**

---

## Who LaunchPulse is for

LaunchPulse is built for people who care about shipping real products, not just demos:

- **Founders & solo entrepreneurs** launching serious MVPs without assembling a full dev team.
- **Agencies & freelancers** delivering more client projects without scaling headcount linearly.
- **Product & growth teams** running experiments with production-grade foundations.
- **Developers** who want to offload boilerplate while keeping control over critical logic.

If you can describe the product clearly, LaunchPulse can give you a live app with infrastructure you’re not embarrassed to show to users (or other engineers).

---

## What you can build

LaunchPulse focuses on **multi-feature, full-stack apps** rather than single-page experiments:

- SaaS dashboards and admin panels
- Booking and scheduling platforms
- Marketplaces and listing platforms
- Internal tools and operational dashboards
- Customer portals, tenant portals, or partner portals

Typical builds include:

- Responsive frontend with navigation, forms, dashboards, and onboarding flows
- Backend APIs, business logic, auth, and background tasks
- Database schemas wired to the app’s flows
- Built-in pages like terms, privacy, and basic policy content
- Dozens of features in a single coordinated build, depending on your brief

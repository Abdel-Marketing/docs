# Storage

LaunchPulse manages several types of storage behind the scenes so your applications stay consistent, reproducible, and safe.

At a high level, we store:

- **Code & assets** – The frontend, backend, and generated artefacts for each project and version.
- **Application data** – Databases and schemas created by the Database Agent or configured in your project.
- **Configuration** – Environment variables, secrets, and settings required for your app to run.
- **Metadata & history** – Agent logs, build history, and previous iterations so you can trace how a project evolved.

You don’t need to manage infrastructure directly, but you *do* control what’s stored, what’s deployed, and how environments are configured. This gives you the safety of managed infrastructure with the clarity of knowing where everything lives.

On this page, you’ll learn how storage is structured in LaunchPulse, what limits and best practices apply, and how to manage data for different environments (development, staging, production).

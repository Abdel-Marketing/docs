# Introduction to LaunchPulse

LaunchPulse is your AI software team in the browser.

<Info>
From a single prompt, LaunchPulse’s multi-agent system plans, builds, tests, and deploys a full-stack web application that’s ready for real users.
</Info>

From your first prompt, LaunchPulse can generate a complete, business-ready product with dozens of features, wired-up flows, and production infrastructure already in place.

## What is LaunchPulse?

LaunchPulse is an AI-powered development platform that turns high-level ideas into live, full-stack web applications.

Behind the scenes, a team of specialised AI agents work together like a digital product squad:

- **Product & UX agents** translate your idea into clear flows and features.
- **Frontend & design agents** build the interface and user experience.
- **Backend & database agents** generate secure, scalable server logic and data models.
- **QA / browser agents** automatically test the app, catch issues, and propose fixes.

<Tip>
You stay in natural language. LaunchPulse handles the code, architecture, and deployment.
</Tip>

## Who is LaunchPulse for?

LaunchPulse is built for anyone who needs to ship software fast without sacrificing seriousness:

- **Founders & solo entrepreneurs** who want to launch an MVP in days, not months.
- **Agencies & freelancers** who need to deliver more client projects with less overhead.
- **Product & growth teams** who want to test ideas quickly with real users.
- **Developers** who want to offload boilerplate and focus on the hard, high-leverage work.

If you have a clear idea of the product, LaunchPulse helps you turn that into a live app with production-grade foundations.

## What can LaunchPulse build?

A LaunchPulse project is not a landing-page toy. It’s a full-stack, live, functional product that can get first users the same day it’s created.

Typical output includes:

- **Frontend** – responsive UI, navigation, forms, dashboards, onboarding flows, and more.
- **Backend** – APIs, business logic, authentication, background tasks, integrations, etc.
- **Database** – schema generation, relations, and data access wired directly into the app.
- **Built-in pages** – terms, privacy, basic legal and policy pages to get you started.
- **Rich feature sets** – up to 30–40+ features in a single build, depending on your prompt.

From SaaS dashboards and internal tools to marketplaces and booking flows, LaunchPulse focuses on complex, multi-feature apps — not just simple CRUD screens.

## How LaunchPulse works

LaunchPulse is designed around a simple three-step flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Describe">
    Tell LaunchPulse what you want to build:

    - Write a detailed prompt about your product, users, and goals.
    - Optionally include existing copy, user stories, or rough wireframes.
    - Define what “success” looks like for this version (MVP, v1, internal tool, etc.).

    The Product & UX agents interpret your description and turn it into a structured plan.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Build">
    LaunchPulse’s agents then build your app:

    - Frontend, backend, and database are generated from the same shared context.
    - Features are implemented in one coordinated build, not one tiny tweak at a time.
    - A browser-based QA agent runs through the app, exercising flows and catching issues.

    You can refine your app with chat iterations — high-impact change requests like:

    - “Add team accounts with roles and permissions.”
    - “Redesign the dashboard to highlight weekly metrics.”
    - “Add a simple billing settings page with plan details.”
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Launch">
    When you’re ready to show the world:

    - LaunchPulse hosts your app on secure, high-performance infrastructure.
    - You get a shareable live URL immediately.
    - You can connect your own custom domain when you’re ready to go public.

    <Check>
      No separate hosting accounts, no manual deployment pipeline, no DevOps setup.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why LaunchPulse instead of other AI builders?

Most AI builders or “vibe coding” tools focus on:

- Generating small pieces of code inside an editor.
- Producing simple UIs or tiny features that require manual glue.
- Leaving testing, architecture, and deployment to you.

LaunchPulse is built for people who want **end-to-end products**, not just code snippets:

- It treats your app as a single system (frontend, backend, database, infra, and QA together).
- It’s optimised for complex, multi-feature builds, not just a login page and a dashboard.
- It bakes in automated testing and review loops so AI doesn’t ship obviously broken flows.

The outcome is closer to:

> “I just hired a small product team for this build”

than:

> “I asked a model for some code.”

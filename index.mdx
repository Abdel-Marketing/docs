Instead of hiring a full dev team or wrestling with code yourself, you describe the software you want and LaunchPulse’s multi-agent system plans, builds, tests, and deploys a full-stack web application that’s ready for real users.

From your first prompt, LaunchPulse can generate a complete, business-ready product with dozens of features, wired-up flows, and production infrastructure already in place.

## **What is LaunchPulse?**

LaunchPulse is an AI-powered development platform that turns high-level ideas into live, full-stack web applications.

Behind the scenes, a team of specialised AI agents work together like a digital product squad:

- **Product & UX agents** to translate your idea into clear flows and features
- **Frontend & design agents** to build the interface and user experience
- **Backend & database agents** to generate secure, scalable server logic and data models
- **QA / browser agents** to automatically test the app, catch issues, and propose fixes

You stay in natural language. LaunchPulse handles the code, architecture, and deployment.

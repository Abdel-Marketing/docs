# Troubleshooting

Things won’t always go perfectly on the first run — and that’s expected. The Troublshooting section is your guide to understanding what went wrong and how to fix it quickly.

Most issues fall into a few categories:

- **Generation issues** – An agent got stuck, produced unexpected behavior, or the app doesn’t match your requirements.
- **Deployment issues** – A build fails to deploy to LaunchPulse Cloud or behaves differently once deployed.
- **Runtime issues** – Errors, crashes, or broken flows when real users interact with your app.
- **Account & billing issues** – Problems related to limits, subscriptions, or access.

LaunchPulse gives you useful signals: agent logs, error messages, version history, and environment diagnostics. Combined with a few common patterns, you can usually resolve issues in minutes, not days.

On this page, you’ll find step-by-step guides for the most common problems, along with tips on when to rerun agents, when to adjust your prompt, and when to contact support.

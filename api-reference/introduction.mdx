## Overview

Welcome to the API reference. Use it alongside the [OpenAPI schema](/api-reference/openapi.json) and the endpoint examples for a full picture of available resources.

## Base URL

All requests target the following base URL:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

Replace `api.example.com` with your deployment’s hostname if you self-host.

## Authentication

The API uses bearer tokens:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Create tokens in the dashboard. Token scopes limit access; request the minimum scope needed for each integration.

## Rate limits

- Default: `1000` requests per minute per token.
- Burst: Short bursts up to `2000` rpm are allowed, but sustained overages return `429` responses with a `Retry-After` header.

## Tooling

- Use the **Mintlify** panel to copy example requests.
- Import `openapi.json` into Postman, Insomnia, or Tonic for interactive testing.

Need help? Reach out to [support](mailto:hi@mintlify.com) with the request ID from the response headers.

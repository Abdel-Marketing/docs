Introduction to LaunchPulse

Meet LaunchPulse, the multi-agent platform and cloud runtime that turns product briefs into live, full-stack web apps.

# Introduction to LaunchPulse

LaunchPulse is your **AI software team + runtime platform** in the browser.

You describe the product you want to ship, and LaunchPulse:

- Plans it like a product squad  
- Builds it like an engineering team  
- Tests it like a QA department  
- Hosts it like a managed cloud platform  

All inside a single, integrated system.

## What makes LaunchPulse different?

Most “AI coding” tools are an editor with a model bolted on. LaunchPulse is **infrastructure-first**:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Agent-native architecture">
    Multiple specialised agents share a single project brain - product, UX, frontend, backend, database, QA, and ops.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integrated cloud runtime">
    Hosting, databases, domains, auth, and test users are wired into the platform from day one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous validation">
    Browser-based QA, validation agents, and structured docs keep the build aligned with the spec as it evolves.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The result feels less like “I asked for some code” and more like:

> “I spun up a small product team and a managed cloud just for this app.”

## From idea to running app

At the very top of LaunchPulse is a simple box:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-idea-box.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse idea input box with example templates for food delivery, fitness platform, and real estate"
  />
</Frame>

You describe your idea in natural language - as detailed as you like. Behind that input sits the rest of the system:

- A **Product & UX layer** that turns your description into specs and flows  
- An **Engineering layer** of agents that compile those specs into code, APIs, and schemas  
- An **Infrastructure layer** (LaunchPulse Cloud) that runs the app, manages data, and exposes a live URL

You focus on the idea and the outcome. LaunchPulse orchestrates everything between.

---

## The LaunchPulse architecture

Conceptually, LaunchPulse is three tightly connected layers.

### 1. Product intelligence layer

This is where your idea becomes something the system can build.

- Product Manager, UX, and architecture agents create PRDs, FRDs, DRDs, and BRDs.  
- Requirements, edge cases, and non-functional constraints are captured up front.  
- This documentation becomes the source of truth for downstream agents.

### 2. App assembly layer

This is the “AI team” people usually see - but running on top of that shared brain.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-structure-overview.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse structure overview graph showing CEO, Product Manager, UX, Frontend, Backend, and Database agents"
  />
</Frame>

- Frontend, Backend, Database, API Architect, and Ops agents work from the same spec.  
- Code, schemas, and APIs are generated as a single coherent system.  
- Validation agents keep checking: *does this still match the spec?*

### 3. Cloud runtime layer

Once the app is assembled, it has somewhere to live — **LaunchPulse Cloud**.

- Managed hosting for your frontend and backend  
- Managed database attached to your project  
- Domains, certificates, and auth wired in  
- Browser QA and monitoring integrated into the same UI

You don’t jump between a model, GitHub, a database dashboard, and a cloud console.  
It’s one environment.

---

## Infrastructure that’s already there

### Managed database per project

Every project ships with a fully managed database that grows with your app.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-database-overview.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse database tab showing tables list and a menu_categories table with editable rows"
  />
</Frame>

- Tables and schemas are generated by the Database Agent.  
- You can browse, filter, edit, and add rows directly from the **Database** tab.  
- No separate DB provisioning, connection strings, or migrations to set up manually.

For quick fixes or demos, you can even click into a cell and update data inline — ideal for testing flows.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-database-edit.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse database view showing how to edit a booking row and add rows"
  />
</Frame>

### Preview & live app in one click

When agents finish a build, your app is already runnable.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-preview-app.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse preview tab showing a barbershop booking app and Live Application status"
  />
</Frame>

- Use the **Preview** tab to interact with the latest build without deploying.  
- Click **View App** to open the live preview in a new window.  
- See exactly what users will experience before you press Deploy.

---

### Auth, test users & roles baked in

Authentication isn’t an afterthought. LaunchPulse creates real accounts and roles for you.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-test-users.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse sidebar showing a list of test users with emails, passwords, and copy buttons"
  />
</Frame>

- Built-in signups, logins, and password resets.  
- Test users generated automatically, visible in the left sidebar.  
- Copy credentials and log in as different user types to test flows quickly.

This lets you validate permissions, dashboards, and role-specific flows before inviting real users.

---

### Browser QA & AI test engineer

On top of normal validation, LaunchPulse can actively **use your app** to test it.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/intro-qa-testing.png"
    alt="LaunchPulse structure overview with an AI Testing Your App panel showing tests passing and running"
  />
</Frame>

- A self-testing browser agent navigates through key flows.  
- It captures runtime errors, broken journeys, and layout issues.  
- Results feed back into the build pipeline so agents can fix issues in context.

Instead of stopping at “it compiles,” LaunchPulse pushes toward **“it behaves correctly for real users.”**

---

## Who LaunchPulse is for

LaunchPulse is built for people who care about shipping real products, not just demos:

- **Founders & solo entrepreneurs** launching serious MVPs without assembling a full dev team.  
- **Agencies & freelancers** delivering more client projects without scaling headcount linearly.  
- **Product & growth teams** running experiments with production-grade foundations.  
- **Developers** who want to offload boilerplate while keeping control over critical logic.

If you can describe the product clearly, LaunchPulse can give you a live app with infrastructure you’re not embarrassed to show to users (or other engineers).

---

## What you can build

LaunchPulse focuses on **multi-feature, full-stack apps** rather than single-page experiments:

- SaaS dashboards and admin panels  
- Booking and scheduling platforms  
- Marketplaces and listing platforms  
- Internal tools and operational dashboards  
- Customer portals, tenant portals, or partner portals

Typical builds include:

- Responsive frontend with navigation, forms, dashboards, and onboarding flows  
- Backend APIs, business logic, auth, and background tasks  
- Database schemas wired to the app’s flows  
- Built-in pages like terms, privacy, and basic policy content  
- Dozens of features in a single coordinated build, depending on your brief

# What is LaunchPulse Cloud?

LaunchPulse Cloud brings everything you need to **launch your web app** together in one place.\
No juggling hosting providers, databases, or DNS panels - and no extra accounts to set up.

Behind the scenes, LaunchPulse Cloud runs on modern, high-performance infrastructure, but you never have to touch any of it. You focus on describing and refining your product, and LaunchPulse handles the rest.

## Hosting & deployment

Every new LaunchPulse project can be deployed directly to **LaunchPulse Cloud**.\
Your app loads quickly, stays stable under load, and is ready for search engines and real users from day one.

**Key behavior**

- Each project builds into a deployable, production-ready application.
- When you’re ready, just click **Deploy** in the top-right corner.
- A live URL is generated instantly - no configs, no DevOps, no CI/CD wiring.

/>

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Validate your app">
    Once the agents have finished, use **Validate** to re-check preview health and run additional QA.\
    This step helps catch issues before you send real users to the app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Click Deploy">
    When the project is marked **Ready to deploy**, hit the **Deploy** button in the top-right corner of the project view.

      alt="LaunchPulse Deploy button"
      style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Share your live URL">
    After deployment completes, you’ll get a live URL you can share with testers, teammates, or first customers.\
    You can connect a custom domain later without changing your app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data & databases

Every LaunchPulse project comes with fully managed databases built in - no servers to spin up, no config files, and no separate tools to learn. You describe the app; LaunchPulse sets up the data layer.

**What you get**

- A fully managed database created automatically for each project.
- Schemas generated by the **Database Agent** and kept in sync with your features.
- Automatic scaling as your app gains users and stores more data.

You’ll find the **Database** tab in the top navigation bar, alongside **Structure, Code, Preview, and Domains**.

From the Database view you can:

- Inspect tables and their relationships.
- Edit, delete, and add rows directly for testing.
- Quickly verify that new features are writing and reading data correctly.

<Tip>
  Use the Database tab during testing to seed demo data, reset broken records, or verify that new flows are storing the right information.
</Tip>

## Domains

LaunchPulse Cloud lets you connect your own **custom domain** directly from the project workspace.

Every project ships with a ready-to-share LaunchPulse URL. When you’re ready to go public, you can:

- Attach a domain you’ve purchased from your preferred registrar.
- Let LaunchPulse handle certificate provisioning and validation.
- Keep domain configuration tied to the project instead of scattered across tools.

You’ll find the **Domains** tab next to **Database** in the top navigation.

<Info>
  For many users, the Domains tab is all you need: add your domain, follow the on-screen DNS instructions, and wait for the certificate check to pass.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain & certificate status">
    In the Domains tab, you’ll see the status of your domain and its TLS certificate.

    - Domains are saved to your project settings and used during certificate setup.
    - A status panel helps you confirm when the certificate is ready.
    - Use the built-in tools to re-check routing if you update DNS.

    Once the certificate is issued and DNS is correct, your app will be available at your custom domain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Advanced: Fly.io manual setup (CLI)">
    For advanced users who prefer manual control, you can manage certificates via Fly.io’s CLI:

    1. Install and log in:
       - `flyctl auth login`
    2. Inspect your app:
       - `flyctl apps list`
       - `flyctl apps open`
       - `flyctl status`
    3. Add a certificate:
       - `flyctl certs add yourdomain.com`
    4. Copy DNS validation instructions:
       - `flyctl certs show yourdomain.com`

    After DNS propagates, set the primary domain both here and in your app configuration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication & user accounts

LaunchPulse Cloud gives you **production-ready authentication** out of the box:

- Signups, logins, and password resets are wired in automatically.
- Roles and permissions for different types of users (admins, team members, end users) are built in.
- You can invite and manage testers safely, using real accounts in a secure environment.

The user information surface is visible in two places:

- In the **left sidebar** of your project, under the live application status.
- In the **top-left bar**, via the person icon.

There you’ll see **test users** - pre-configured accounts you can use to log in and explore the app like a real user.

<img
  src="/images/cloud-test-users.png"
  alt="LaunchPulse test users"
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '12px', margin: '20px 0' }}
/>

<Tip>
  Copy one of the test user credentials and click **View App** to log in as a real user.\
  This is the fastest way to verify authentication, roles, and key flows before onboarding your own users.
</Tip>

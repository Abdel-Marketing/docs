LaunchPulse combines the speed of vibe coding with guardrails that catch a lot of problems before they hit production:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Advanced QA testing">
    Every build runs through a browser agent that simulates user interactions and catches functional issues before you publish.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure architecture">
    Projects use trusted hosting and database platforms. Roles and permissions are baked in, reducing the need to roll your own auth from scratch.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Transparent iterations">
    Each chat iteration preserves state and shows a diff, so you can see what changed and revert if needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scalable infrastructure">
    Databases and hosting are designed to grow with your user base, so you can focus on fixing product issues — not servers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Even with these guardrails, AI doesn’t eliminate bugs or misalignment entirely.  
You’ll still need to validate flows, review changes, and handle edge cases.

## Quick triage: what’s going wrong?

Most issues fall into a few buckets:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Functionality bugs">
    Features not working as expected, broken forms, navigation errors, or flows that get stuck.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance problems">
    Slow pages, high memory usage, long loading spinners, or timeouts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integration failures">
    External APIs failing, webhooks not firing, or data not being saved/loaded correctly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Security concerns">
    Secrets exposed, improper access control, or unexpected behaviours around permissions and auth.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design & UX issues">
    Cluttered layouts, confusing flows, or inconsistent styling that makes the product hard to use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="“Something feels off”">
    The app technically works, but the flow doesn’t match your intent or users get lost.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-step troubleshooting flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Reproduce the issue">
    Use LaunchPulse’s preview or staging environment to replicate the problem.

    - Follow the same steps your users took.  
    - Note the exact page, action, and any error message.  
    - Let the browser agent run the flow as well — it can surface hidden console errors and crashes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Inspect logs & errors">
    Check what the app is telling you:

    - Look at browser console errors for missing dependencies, invalid inputs, or failed network requests.  
    - Review server logs (if available) around the time of the failure.  
    - Capture screenshots or copy error messages for later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Iterate with a clear prompt">
    Turn what you found into a precise iteration request:

    - Describe the bug and expected behaviour:  
      _“Users cannot reset their password; an error appears after submitting the form.”_  
    - Mention the affected page/flow and any error text.  
    - Ask the agent to regenerate or patch the relevant logic, not the whole app.

    The agent can then update code, flows, or validation to address the specific issue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Request refactors for messy areas">
    If the problem is maintainability or complexity:

    - Ask for a targeted refactor, e.g.  
      _“Refactor the user registration flow to improve error handling and make the code easier to extend.”_  
    - Focus on one module or flow at a time.

    Refactors help reduce follow-up bugs and make future iterations smoother.
  </Step>

  <Step title="5. Edit manually when necessary">
    If repeated AI attempts don’t fully resolve the issue:

    - Open the code editor and adjust code manually.  
    - Pair with a developer for tricky edge cases or advanced integrations.  
    - Use the agent as a helper (for suggestions and explanations), not the final authority.
  </Step>

  <Step title="6. Re-test end-to-end">
    Once changes are in place:

    - Re-run the browser QA agent to walk through the affected flows.  
    - Manually test the same scenarios users experienced.  
    - Confirm the fix didn’t introduce regressions elsewhere.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting by issue type

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Functionality bugs">
    Common symptoms:

    - Buttons that don’t do anything.  
    - Forms that never submit or always error.  
    - Navigation that loops or sends users to the wrong page.

    **How to approach**

    - Reproduce the exact flow step by step.  
    - Inspect form validation, required fields, and API responses.  
    - Use a clear iteration prompt:  
      _“Fix the profile update form so it saves changes and shows a success message.”_
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance problems">
    Common symptoms:

    - Slow initial page loads.  
    - Pages that freeze on heavy operations.  
    - Timeouts on API calls.

    **How to approach**

    - Check network requests for large payloads or repeated calls.  
    - Ask the agent to optimise specific areas:  
      _“Optimise the dashboard data fetching and add loading states so it doesn’t block the UI.”_  
    - Consider pagination, caching, or background jobs for heavy tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration failures">
    Common symptoms:

    - Data not syncing with external services.  
    - Webhooks not firing or being rejected.  
    - 4xx/5xx errors from third-party APIs.

    **How to approach**

    - Verify the external service is reachable and properly configured.  
    - Double-check API keys and environment variables (never paste them into prompts).  
    - Ask the agent to log request/response details (without logging secrets) for easier debugging.  
    - For unsupported integrations, you may need custom code or middleware.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security concerns">
    Common symptoms:

    - Users seeing data they shouldn’t.  
    - Admin-only actions available to regular users.  
    - Secrets appearing in logs or code.

    **How to approach**

    - Ensure all secrets are stored in environment variables, not hard-coded.  
    - Re-check roles and permissions in your auth layer.  
    - Ask the agent explicitly:  
      _“Review access control for the admin dashboard and lock it down to admin users only.”_  
    - For high-stakes apps, integrate static analysis (SAST) or an external security scanner.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Design & UX issues">
    Common symptoms:

    - Users get lost in the flow.  
    - Layout feels cluttered or inconsistent.  
    - Important actions are hidden or unclear.

    **How to approach**

    - Identify the specific screens that feel heavy or confusing.  
    - Prompt the agent to simplify:  
      _“Simplify the onboarding flow to 3 clear steps and remove unnecessary fields.”_  
    - Focus on a smaller number of high-value actions per screen.
  </Accordion>

## Best practices to avoid recurring issues

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Prompt clearly & iteratively">
    Break complex tasks into smaller steps. Provide concrete requirements, examples, and constraints instead of vague instructions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Treat AI like a junior dev">
    Generated code is powerful, but you should still review it, run tests, and make sure it matches your standards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test early & often">
    Use staging/preview environments to exercise key flows before pushing changes to production.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Protect secrets">
    Never paste API keys or credentials into prompts. Configure them through environment settings and keep them out of logs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document & version">
    Keep track of what each iteration changes. Use diffs and history to roll back if a change introduces new problems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design with constraints">
    Ask for simpler flows and fewer steps when in doubt — complexity breeds bugs and UX issues.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to contact support

Sometimes the fastest path is to bring in a human.

<Info>
If you’re blocked by something that doesn’t make sense, reach out with:
</Info>

- A short description of the issue.  
- The URL or name of the affected project.  
- Any error messages or logs you’ve captured.  
- The last prompt/iteration that preceded the issue.

This context helps support (and future you) pinpoint what’s going on.

## Keep the speed, keep the quality

Vibe coding unlocks rapid prototyping and removes a lot of boilerplate — but it also introduces risks like:

- Security vulnerabilities  
- Maintainability challenges  
- Debugging complexity  
- Limited integrations  
- UX/design pitfalls

LaunchPulse is built to offset those risks with:

- Secure infrastructure  
- Automated testing and QA agents  
- Built-in roles and permissions  
- Transparent, diffable iterations

# Accounts & Subscriptions

## What is a “Full-Featured Project”?

A **Full-Featured Project** in LaunchPulse is more than a template — it’s a complete, live product:

- A **full-stack web application** (frontend + backend + database).
- **Production-ready**, so you can onboard your first real users within the same day.
- **Business-functional**, with flows and features wired up (not just static pages).

It also comes with:

- Built-in content for:
  - Privacy Policy
  - Terms & Conditions
  - Basic legal / policy pages appropriate for a modern web product
- The potential for **40+ features** from the very first prompt, depending on what you ask the agent to build.

You can then refine this project with chat iterations, add features, and evolve it as your business grows.

## Chat Iterations

Each Premium subscription includes **15 Chat Iterations** for your Full-Featured Project.

An **iteration** is a significant change request to your app, such as:

- “Add a multi-step onboarding flow for new users.”
- “Refactor the dashboard to support team accounts and roles.”
- “Integrate a simple billing page and update the navigation.”

The LaunchPulse Agent uses these iterations to extend or re-build parts of your app while preserving what’s already working.

<Info>
  You start with **15 iterations** for your project. When you need more, you can purchase additional iteration packs as an add-on.
</Info>

## Additional projects & add-ons

Your Premium plan includes **1 Full-Featured Project** by default.

If you want to:

- Launch a second product
- Build a different version of your app for another market
- Test a completely new idea

…you can buy **additional projects** as needed.

Each additional project comes with its own:

- Full-stack setup
- Features
- Iteration allowance (based on the add-on you choose)

You can also purchase **extra iteration packs** for existing projects without changing your main subscription.

## How billing works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Single Premium subscription">
    You pay for the **Premium** plan on a recurring basis (for example, monthly).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add-ons billed separately">
    Extra projects and extra iteration packs are billed on top of your base Premium subscription.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transparent usage">
    In your billing/usage view you’ll see:

    - Your current plan
    - How many projects you’re using
    - Remaining iterations for each project
    - Any add-ons you’ve purchased
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Managing your subscription

From the **Billing & Subscription** page, you can:

- View your current plan and what’s included.
- See usage (projects and remaining iterations).
- Purchase additional projects or iteration packs.
- Update your payment method.
- View billing history and download invoices.
- Cancel or resume your subscription (according to your plan’s policy).

<Tip>
  Keep an eye on remaining iterations for each project so you can plan big changes as intentional iteration requests instead of lots of tiny tweaks.
</Tip>

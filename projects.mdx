# Projects

The **Projects** view is your home base in LaunchPulse.  
Every card on this page is a separate, full LaunchPulse app - with its own agents, database, and deployment.

<Info>
Use the Projects hub to switch between apps, check remaining usage, and spin up new builds.
</Info>

In the screenshot above:

1. **Projects panel** – The main area where all your projects are listed.  
2. **Monthly usage** – Shows how many **projects / iterations** you’ve used this month and how many are left.  
3. **Menu sidebar** – The file icon that opens the Projects menu from anywhere in the app.

## What is a project?

A **project** in LaunchPulse is a complete application:

- One idea → one project  
- Contains your agents’ work, code, database, preview, and deployments  
- Has its own usage (iterations), history, and environments

Treat each project as a single product, client build, or major experiment.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="One card = one app">
    Each card in the Projects view represents a full LaunchPulse app with agents, code, and database behind it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Independent sandboxes">
    Projects are isolated from each other, so you can experiment freely without affecting other apps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track status at a glance">
    See validation state, last activity, and quick actions (Validate, Resume) right from the grid.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Opening the Projects hub

You can get to your projects from anywhere using the sidebar.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Open the sidebar">
    Click the **file icon** in the left sidebar.

    This opens the **Menu** panel, where you’ll see:

    - A **New Chat** button  
    - An **Open Projects** section  
    - Your **Monthly Usage** bar at the bottom
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Go to your projects">
    In the Menu, click **Open Projects**.

    You’ll land on the Projects page, where all of your existing apps are listed as cards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reading the Projects page

Each project card gives you a quick snapshot of that app:

- **Name & description** – The project’s title and a short summary of what it does.  
- **Sandbox status** – Whether the app has been validated or still needs checks.  
- **Actions**:
  - **Validate** – Run validation/QA to check the app’s health.  
  - **Resume** – Jump back into agents/chat for that specific project.

<Tip>
Use the **Sandbox Status** and **Validate** button to make sure a project is healthy before deploying or inviting testers.
</Tip>

## Usage: projects & iterations left

At the bottom of the Menu panel you’ll see the **Monthly Usage** bar:

- The first number shows how many **project generations** you’ve used.  
- The second number (after the slash) shows your total included projects.  
- The green `(+X)` indicates any bonus or add-on capacity.

Example: `8 / 8 (+3)` means:

- You’ve used 8 of 8 included generations  
- You still have 3 extra bonus generations available

<Info>

## Creating a new project

You can start a new project directly from the Projects view.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Click + New Project">
    In the top-right corner of the Projects page, click **+ New Project**.

    This opens the same experience as the homepage prompt, but scoped to your workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Describe your app">
    Enter a detailed description of the web app you want to build:

    - Who it’s for  
    - The main flows and features  
    - Any must-have pages or integrations

    The Product Manager and UX agents will use this as the foundation for the build.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Launch the agents">
    Submit your idea and LaunchPulse will:

    - Create a new project card in the Projects view  
    - Take you to the project’s **Structure** page  
    - Start running agents to plan, build, and test the app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing existing projects

From the Projects page you can:

- **Resume work** – Click **resume** on a project card to jump back into chat and agents.  
- **Validate builds** – Hit **Validate** to re-check preview health and rerun automated QA.  
- **Organise your workspace** – Use project names and descriptions to keep client work, experiments, and internal tools easy to scan.

<Tip>
Use clear, descriptive project names (e.g. `clientname-crm-dashboard` or `internal-ops-booking-tool`) so the Projects view stays readable as your workspace grows.
</Tip>

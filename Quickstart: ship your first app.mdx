# Quickstart: from idea to live app

Turn your idea into a **production-ready web app with just one prompt.**

LaunchPulse works like a small product team made of AI agents: Product, UX, Frontend, Backend, Database, Validation, and Browser QA all collaborate on a single build so you don’t have to juggle tools or handoffs.

## What LaunchPulse gives you in one run

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Full-stack applications">
    Frontend, backend, and database generated in one coordinated project - not three separate tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web apps you can publish">
    Launch live web platforms, connect domains, and share a URL the same day the app is generated.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-powered development">
    Multiple specialised agents plan, build, repair, and validate your app instead of a single “do-everything” model.
  </Card>

## How the product works (high level)

Here’s what happens behind the scenes when you create a project:

- The **Product Manager agent** turns your idea into structured docs (PRD, FRD, DRD, BRD).  
- Those docs are passed to **UX, Frontend, Backend, and Database agents**, which implement flows, APIs, and schemas.  
- A **Validation layer** checks that the build still matches the agreed spec.  
- A **Browser agent** runs through the app like a real user, finds non-working elements, and helps fix them.

You describe the product once. The agents do the heavy lifting.

## Step 1 – Describe your idea

From the homepage, start by typing what you want to build in natural language.  
There’s no hard limit on detail - the more context you give, the better the result.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write your product brief">
    In the **“Describe your idea…”** box, explain:

    - Who the app is for  
    - What core flows it needs (e.g. onboarding, dashboard, bookings, messaging)  
    - Any must-have features, integrations, or constraints  

    Example ideas:

    - “Food delivery marketplace for local restaurants with drivers and customer tracking.”  
    - “B2B SaaS dashboard for agencies to manage client campaigns.”  
    - “Real estate platform for diplomats to browse and book high-end rentals.”
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit your prompt">
    When you’re happy with your brief, hit **Enter** or click the send button.  
    This creates a new LaunchPulse project and kicks off the agent pipeline.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2 – Watch your project being built

After you submit your idea, you’re taken to the **project page**.  
This is where you’ll see your app getting generated live.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Follow the agent pipeline">
    On the left, you’ll see **agent tasks** progressing:

    - Product Manager Agent  
    - Database Agent  
    - Backend Agent  
    - API Architect Layer Agent  
    - UX, Frontend, and other agents depending on your project

    Each one moves from “in progress” to “done” as it finishes its part of the build.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the structure view">
    In the main panel, the **Structure** tab shows your agent graph - how each agent fits into the pipeline for this project.

    You can use this to understand:

    - Which agents ran  
    - What they produced  
    - How far along your project is (e.g. “Ready to deploy”)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3 – Validate, iterate, and test

Once the initial build is done, LaunchPulse moves into validation and refinement.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Automatic validation">
    A validation agent checks the build against the original requirements (PRD/FRD/BRD) and flags gaps or inconsistencies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browser QA runs your app">
    A Browser agent opens your app, navigates through flows, and catches runtime errors and broken experiences.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat-based iterations">
    Use chat to request high-impact changes: add features, adjust flows, or clean up UX. Each iteration keeps your project history intact.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Use the chat panel on the project page to refine:

- “Add a multi-step onboarding for new users.”  
- “Simplify the pricing page to two plans and update the navigation.”  
- “Add a basic billing settings page with plan name and renewal date.”

## When you’re happy: publish

After validation and a few iterations:

1. Preview your app in the **Preview** tab.  
2. When it looks good and flows correctly, click **Deploy**.  
3. Get a live URL immediately, and connect a custom domain when you’re ready.
